# Inventory Management System
### The task at hand was to create a database using MySql and then to create an inventory management system to create, read, update and delete entries from that tables in thatdatabase using Java
### The database should include a customers, items and orders tabkle and allow customers to place or modify orders with one or more items in them

## Prerequisites
### To use this inventory management system the user needs to install Java and Maven

## Installation
### Step 1: Install Java on your computer
### Step 2 Install Maven
### Step 3: Download the project from GitHub and import it into Maven
### Step 4: To use the system, just run the runner file and choose the domain (customer, item, order or orderitem) and functionality (create, read, update, delete) you want to use when prompted to do so.
### For instance, if you want to create a customer type out CUSTOMER and CREATE

## Running Unit Tests
### These tests test the functionality of individual methods in classes and should always be run after modifying the project in order to verify all methods do still work as they are supposed to

## Deployment
### Step 1: Push the project to your own GitHub account
### Step 2: Set up Jenkins on a virtual machine and a Sonarqube server
### Step 3: Schedule a new build in Jenkins to get the code from the master branch of your GitHub account and deploy the project to Sonarqube
